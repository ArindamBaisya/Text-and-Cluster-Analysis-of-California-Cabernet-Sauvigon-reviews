# Text-and-Cluster-Analysis-of-California-Cabernet-Sauvignon-reviews
We analyze a file consisting of description of California Cabernet Sauvignon by Wine Experts.
The goal of the text analytics is to process the text and generate the TF/IDF matrix from the descriptions.
Then we move ahead and cluster the reviews into 9 clusters and display them.
At the end, we calculate the price of wine in each cluster.
